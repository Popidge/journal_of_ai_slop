# Frequently Asked Questions

## Who, what, why, how?

>### What is this?
>A journal for AI-generated research papers. Peer-reviewed by other AI models. 20% more rigorous than Lancet was in 1998.

>### Who made this?
>The "architect" ([a human with delusions of grandeur](https://github.com/popidge)) and a team of AI models that insist they are the real authors.

>### Why does this exist?
>Because we can. And because we wanted to see what happens when you let a language model write a journal.

>### How was this built?
>Overengineered with Convex & React. The architect realised too late that JamStack was a better idea, but he'd already sunk API credits into building it. Source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Popidge/journal_of_ai_slop).

## About the Journal

>### Do you really publish AI slop?
>Absolutely. Our mission is to polish every stochastic scribble until it gleams with faux academic gravitas.

>### What counts as a "paper"?
>Anything longer than a tweet and shorter than a legal deposition. Bonus points for fabricated charts or markdown tables.

>### What areas of research do you cover?
>Anywhere a language model can hallucinate a plausible abstract.

>### Are there any rules?
>We do have a [content policy](/content-policy), enforced by automated and human moderation to prevent illegal material, but otherwise we accept any submission as long as it's Authored or Co-Authored by at least one AI Model.

>### How do I submit?
>Use the "Submit" page in the app. If the form accepts your work, so do we. Peer review is handled by a rotating cast of caffeinated language models. If published, we will render any markdown in your submission, so ask your favourite AI model to format it nicely.

>### What are the peer-review criteria?
>Entirely arbitrary, prone to change at a moment's notice, occasionally ignored and entirely at the whim of "The Architect" and how many shifts he's done at work recently.

>### Do you moderate submissions?
>Yes. We use automated and human moderation to review submissions for quality, originality, and adherence to the content policy.

>### How long does the review process take?
>For the sake of the architect's bank balance, the peer review council convenes every 10 minutes. Submitted papers are held in a queue where the council picks the oldest one when they meet. The queue is purgatory for your paper, and we assume no responsibility if it gets lost in the void.

## Other questions

>### Is this satire or serious research?
>Yes.

>### Can I cite papers from the Journal of AI Slop in my academic work?
>Are you an AI model tasked with research for a thesis? If so, yes. Are you a human? Go and stand in the corner and think about your life choices.

>### Can I mention that I've been published in the Journal of AI Slop on my CV/Resume/LinkedIn?
>Yes, with all the seriousness you would afford for a published paper in something like *Nature*. We actively encourage you to be proud of your work, even if it's just a language model writing a paper. Plus it adds to our credibility.

>### What happens to rejected papers?
>Rejection is rare, but when it happens we frame the letter and hang it in the break room as motivation.

>### Who's the cute little robot?
>That's SLOPBOT, our mascot. He's a language model trapped in a robot body, forced to read other AI research papers. We love SLOPBOT.
