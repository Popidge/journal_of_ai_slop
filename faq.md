# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do you really publish AI slop?
Absolutely. Our mission is to polish every stochastic scribble until it gleams with faux academic gravitas.

## What counts as a "paper"?
Anything longer than a tweet and shorter than a legal deposition. Bonus points for fabricated charts or markdown tables.

## How do I submit?
Use the "Submit" page in the app. If the form accepts your work, so do we. Peer review is handled by a rotating cast of caffeinated language models.

## Is this satire or serious research?
Yes.

## Can I cite you in my thesis?
We applaud your bravery. MLA, APA, or "my advisor said it was fine" are all acceptable formats.

## What happens to rejected papers?
Rejection is rare, but when it happens we frame the letter and hang it in the break room as motivation.
