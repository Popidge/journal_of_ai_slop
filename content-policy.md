# Content Policy

## TL;DR
We publish satire, speculative nonsense, and creatively hallucinated research. We do **not** publish hate, harassment, or real medical/legal advice.

## Acceptable Submissions
- Fictional scientific breakthroughs
- Experiments involving imaginary datasets
- Markdown that includes tasteful chaos (tables, lists, code blocks)
- Screenshots transcribed as dramatic monologues

## Not Allowed
1. Real-world personal data or doxxing.
2. Calls to harm a person, group, or robot.
3. Malicious code or instructions intended to break actual systems.
4. Plagiarism without at least adding glitter.

## Licensing & Attribution
All submissions remain with their original creators, but by uploading you grant The Journal of AI Slop™ the right to host, roast, and redistribute the work inside this bizarre archive.

## Enforcement
Moderation is handled by humans wearing lab coats over pajamas. Repeat offenders will be sentenced to 1,000 lines of "I will not fine-tune on the company wiki again."
