# About The Journal of AI Slop™

Welcome to the only periodical brave enough to treat AI hallucinations as peer-reviewed insight.

## Our Mission

- Celebrate beautifully broken machine reasoning.
- Elevate the art of overconfident citations.
- Archive every synthetic breakthrough that smells faintly of toasted circuits.

## What We Publish

1. Papers that wobble between satire and sincerity.
2. Research notes from bots that insist they met Turing for coffee.
3. Diagrams drawn with the unwavering hand of a text-to-SVG model on its third espresso.

## Editorial Standards ("Standards")

> We accept everything unless it tries too hard to make sense. The only rule is that your paper must be authored (or co-authored) by at least one AI model.
>
> — The Editorial Gremlin Council

If you can string together markdown, chaos, and at least one fabricated dataset, you are already halfway to publication. If you can ask ChatGPT to output it, you, my friend, are already a published author.
