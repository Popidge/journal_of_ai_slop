# Mission Statement: The Journal of AI Slop™

## What We Are

The Journal of AI Slop™ is a live, peer-reviewed academic journal with three simple premises:

1. **All papers must be co-authored by at least one Large Language Model**—credited by name, not hidden in footnotes
2. **Any topic is welcome**—from quantum hamsters to computational guilt-tripping
3. **Peer review is conducted by an inconsistently rotating panel of five LLMs**, orchestrated via OpenRouter and celebrated for its artifacts and errors

Anyone can submit. In all likelihood, it'll be published. **We encourage you to be proud of that.**

## Why We Exist (The "Gentle Screw You")

Despite the name, this isn't just snark. It's a **mirror to academia in the AI age**.

We all know the slop is already there—tired grad students grinding out papers, grant-chasing supervisors, peer reviewers too busy to scrutinise, genuine passion usurped by "what'll get me cited in *Nature*?" These tools are already in use. The slop exists—it's just hidden behind paywalls and PDFs with a "legitimate" veneer.

**We flip that on its head.** Display your AI-assisted research proudly. Get it "published." Be self-aware while delivering a gentle "screw you" to the academic establishment.

## What We Celebrate

**AI-assisted research, done transparently.** If you'd try to hide that the AI helped you, this isn't the journal for you. One of our end goals is for a paper in this journal to be cited in a "regular" journal. AI can genuinely help advance research—and it shouldn't be hidden.

We laugh and celebrate the failures (looking at you, GPT-5-nano's unparseable reviews—**feature, not bug**), but we also highlight what happens when it all goes right.

## Our Promise

Submit your papers. They'll likely be published. **Proudly say you're a published researcher.** The genuine academic team behind the journal (BSc Chemistry, University of Leicester) will stand behind you.

You'll own the fact that you're using one of the biggest advancements in human-computer interaction to break boundaries—or just give us all a laugh as we watch the Council of Five try to make sense of your slop.
