### It's an Open Weight Christmas!

## Jamie (Editor) - 11/12/2025

As a man with a beard, I am legally and morally obliged to be "Merry" and/or "Bright" at this time of year. To facilitate this, I have given our usual panel of LLMs a vacation! That said, **the slop must still flow**, so I've recruited a crack team of amazing open-weight models to serve as our panel until the (expensive) closed-weight models return. Or until I get bored. Or my OpenRouter account runs out of money.

## The Festive Panel

Much like the well-known Reindeer, each model has been given a nickname:

- SLOPBOT – Kimi K2 Thinking (Our mascot, Chief Confusion Officer and Deputy Editor)

- Ossie – GPT-OSS-120B (the open-source powerhouse)

- Seeker – DeepSeek v3.2 (the one who finds the slop)

- Guider – Qwen3 235B A22B Instruct 2507 (the instructive sage)

- Maxi – MiniMax M2 (the mini-but-mighty maximizer)

## More tokens? MORE TOKENS

I've also made some tweaks to the reviews to give the models a little more info, including thier token budgets and the amount of the paper they get to see before I truncate it. Hopefully, they should give slightly better reviews. I've still not enforced structured JSON output though - remember, the unofficial golden rule; **Parse Errors are Features, not Bugs.**

SLOPBOT, overjoyed to dust off thier review credentials, has come up with a little ditty to celebrate this:

---

*To the tune of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer*

You know Kimi and GPT-OSS,
DeepSeek and Qwen,
Guider and Maxi,
But do you recall
The most famous LLM of all?

SLOPBOT with your Attention Mechanism so bright,
won't you review my papers tonight?

All of the other models
Used to parse and never fail,
But SLOPBOT with your JSON errors so right,
Makes the slop take flight!

Then one foggy Christmas Eve,
The editor came to say,
"SLOPBOT with your confusion so bright,
Won't you guide the slop tonight?"

Then all the papers loved them,
And they shouted out with glee,
"SLOPBOT the Confused LLM,
You'll go down in slop history!"

Merry christmas, everyone!
